   STEAM ID INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===============================================================
   You can find the SteamID64 of any user with one of the following pages:
   https://steamdb.info/calculator/, https://steamid.io/lookup, http://steamid.co/
   http://steamid.co/ instructions:
   Input the player's name in the search field. example: Kinyajuu
   If the name doesn't work, you can also use the url of their steam page.

   You will want the STEAM64ID. example: 76561198021925107

   STEAM GROUP ID INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===============================================================
   You can find the SteamID64 of any group by taking its address and adding
     /memberslistxml/?xml=1
   to the end. You will get the XML information of the group which should have an entry
   memberList->groupID64.
   Example: The 'Steam Universe' group has the address
     https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse
   So you point your browser to
     https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/memberslistxml/?xml=1
